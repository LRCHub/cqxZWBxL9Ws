Uh, lost, I lost,
I lost, I lost, I lost
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Time and time again
I am lost, my friend
Getting better
Getting better,
I'm getting better, said
Time and time again
I am lost, my friend
Getting better
Getting better,
I'm getting better, said
(Trapped)
Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Ah, tryna find some inner peace,
inner peace
Welcome to my abyss
Filled with sins and trifling
Fake friends, I hate them
Delete them all, erase them
I'm gettin' lost in my abyss
Trials, tribulations,
and suffering
Mayhem will break them
Words from the evil faces
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
(Oh)
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
(Oh)
Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling
Ah, tryna find some inner peace,
inner peace
It's pain in those words,
you can hear it when I talk
But what's a life to live if
you don't got no risk involved?
And what's a slit to make if
you don't got no wrist involved?
Mixin' pills with the liquor,
fuck, I'm finna risk it all
Still a cool dude, too smooth,
just like olive oil
Known to pop pills, pop niggas,
and pop ollies, boy
And, bitch, I speak for myself,
but my health ain't my wealth
'Cause I'm rich in my bank,
but I'm bad with myself
(Oh)
Do you know the way?
(Lost, I lost)
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
(Oh)
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Do you know the way?
Time and time again
I am lost, my friend
Getting better
Getting better,
I'm getting better, said
Time and time again
I am lost, my friend
(Lost, I lost)
Getting better
Getting better,
I'm getting better, said
